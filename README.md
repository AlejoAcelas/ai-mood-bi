# Long-Term Trends in the Public Perception of Artificial Intelligence

This project extends the fascinating 2017 analysis by Ethan Fast and Microsoft researcher Eric Horvitz on how the public perception of artificial intelligence has evolved over 30 years, as seen through the lens of articles published in the New York Times.

Some key extensions and improvements in this updated analysis:

* The timeframe is extended to 2023, providing an up-to-date view on AI trends
* LLMs are used to reduce the cost of labeling and analyzing the text data by 100x
* Articles are labeled on additional important dimensions beyond the original analysis, including the application realm, AI capabilities discussed, and fields of AI mentioned.
* (Upcoming) The results are explored and visualized using Microsoft Power BI, showcasing how this powerful business intelligence tool can be used to uncover insights from unstructured text data
* (Upcoming) Power Automate is leveraged to automatically retrieve new articles and update the analysis on a monthly basis, enabling ongoing tracking of AI perceptions over time
